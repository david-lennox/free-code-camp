Free Code Camp exercises that can be completed without Redux. It uses

in a table. Each sub-folder of src is an exercise or experiment.

Free Code Camp exercises are prefixed with fcc.

To start the development server just type: `npm install` followed by
 `npm start`.  
 
 The application is bootstrapped with the create-react-app tool. See
